A Great Journey
        
        My aunt dropped Frederick and I off at the designated drop off point for all the participants this year it didn’t seem like much at first, but that started changing rather quickly as more people started to appear at the drop off point. They soon called us into the different dressing rooms to set us up with the impact armor that was just a selection of different white clothing that had been coated with a chemical to change color on impact with the weapons, which were also coated with the chemical. They also sprayed our exposed body parts, based on the type of clothing we choose, I had my legs and arms sprayed because I wore some shorts and a t-shirt. After that they pushed us through breakfast and then they put us into different cars and trucks, and drove us off to the different starting point for the competing players in the challenge. I had already chosen my weapons a bow with some heavy foam arrows and and some heavy foam throwing knives. When they rung the siren that's when we all knew it was time to run in and start the games it was something close to 7am when we had started and I was sneaking around like it was not my business running from building to building roof to roof avoiding people as much as possible that when I got spotted by two people working together and started running like my life depend it on it because It most definitely did depend on it. Thats when it started to dawn on me that I could stop right there and quit, but I didn’t and I ran up the stairs and sat on the window ledge aiming my bow and arrow at the two people who were coming
